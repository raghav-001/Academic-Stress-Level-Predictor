  <li>Study plan (Regular or Procrastinated)</li>
  <li>Stress level as assessed by students (No stress/Maneagable/Highly stressed)</li>
 </ul>

Various ML models - Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, Boosting techniques - AdaBoost and GradientBoost are applied using R programming and the results are analyzed in the RMD file. Oversampling method is used to remove imbalance in the dataset.
